# World Cup 2022 Match Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive visual dashboard for analyzing a World Cup 2022 football match between Brazil and Korea. It allows users to track and visualize match statistics, including xG (expected goals), possession data, and shot maps for various teams, offering insights into performance across multiple games.

## Features
- **xG Flow Charts**: Displays the flow of expected goals for teams over time during a match.
- **Possession Charts**: Visualizes the percentage of possession each team had throughout the game.
- **Shot Maps**: Plots the location of shots taken by each team during the match, providing a clear view of offensive performance.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Built using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, making the plots dynamic and customizable.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for data processing and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For efficient handling and manipulation of match data.
- **Matplotlib**: To generate detailed visualizations such as shot maps, xG charts, and possession charts.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For combining code, visuals, and analysis in one interactive environment.
